# The Government

We are an online gaming community. We play Rust and other games.

Join the Discord [discord.gg/rustgov](https://discord.gg/rustgov)

## Ranks

Everyone gets colorful ranks and insignia. The ranking algorithm is impartial & fair, so anyone can rise to become a General.

## Ban Court

The top 50 members vote on every ban. The 2/3 supermajority needed makes it easy to overturn unfair bans.

## Auto Scaling Voice Chats

A unique feature of The Government discord is the auto scaling voice chat rooms. When someone joins an empty room, another identical one is spawned. When several rooms are left empty, they are automatically deleted. This solves a common headache in Discord where there's always too many or too few rooms.

## Yen

The Government has its own money. Every yen in circulation is backed by Rust skins in Steam Marketplace. Government members use them to trade items in-game. The gov has an active economy with members finding various inventive ways to trade with other members for yen.

## Artillery Calculator

Use this command to shoot rockets in Rust with centimeter accuracy at long range.
```
!artillery TargetX TargetY TargetZ FiringX FiringY FiringZ
```
Example:
```
!artillery -1206 25 2009 -1102 31 1934
```
Paste the above into the Discord and the bot will output a helpful image that shows you how high to aim your rocket launcher to hit the target on the nose. Use the `printpos` command in-game to get the coordinates. Use the NESW markings on the compass to get the coordinates of areas you can't reach, like the bottom-middle of an enemy's base.
