**__Bill of Rights__**

As a Citizen of The Government, you have rights.

**The right to an environment free of racism, homophobia, and sexism**

Bans will be issued for gay-bashing, racism, sexism, etc.

**The right to not be killed or raided by fellow citizens**

No matter how mad you get - don't do it! Even if someone does it to you. No doorcamping, unwanted TK, or raiding other clan members. It makes people quit the wipe, which is an offense against everybody, not only the direct victim.

**The right to build your own base, and decide who gets the code**

You decide what to keep, and what to share with the group. This stops other members from grubbing your stuff while you're offline.

**The right to keep your own BPs**

You should share Blueprints freely with the clan. But we can't make you. Trading (or withholding) valueable BPs is legal.

**The right to a mature adult environment**

No young children. There is no hard age limit. The criteria are behavior and sound of voice. Rust can be a harsh game, so we don't want to risk hurting any children.

**The right to fair play**

No auto-aim, ESP, or other cheats. Being the very best means we win straight-up.

**The right to a fair trial**

If you get banned, a trial is held in Ban Court. A 2/3 majority is needed to ban someone, which makes unfair bans easy to overturn.
