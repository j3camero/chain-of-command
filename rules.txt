**__Bill of Rights__**

As a Citizen of The Government, you have rights.

**The right to an environment free of racism, homophobia, and sexism**

Bans will be issued for gay-bashing, racism, sexism, etc.

**The right to not be killed or raided by fellow citizens**

No matter how mad you get - don't do it! Even if someone does it to you. No doorcamping, unwanted TK, or raiding other clan members. It makes people quit the wipe, which is an offense against everybody, not only the direct victim.

**The right to build your own base, and decide who gets the code**

You decide what to keep, and what to share with the group. Trading (or withholding) valuable items, intel, and BPs is legal.

**The right to not get shot by turrets**

If you add turrets to your base, do it behind compound walls. If you use turrets to control a road or monument, add a gate bypass if possible. You can't "auth everyone". Citizens can destroy private turrets shooting into public areas (excluding monuments).

**The right to a mature adult environment**

No young children. There is no hard age limit. The criteria are behavior and sound of voice. Rust can be a harsh game, so we don't want to risk hurting any children.

**The right to fair play**

No auto-aim, ESP, or other cheats. Being the very best means we win straight-up.

**The right to a fair trial**

If you get banned, a trial is held in Ban Court. All bans must be approved by a majority vote of the top 50 Government members, which makes unfair bans easy to overturn.

**The right to decision-making in balloting activities, free from external influence**

All members have the autonomy to decide on server votes, ban court votes, policy votes, and vote-related activities. Any attempts to bribe, threaten, coerce, or exert undue pressure by means of practice or communication, that could be reasonably considered to be excessive or persistent violate this right.
